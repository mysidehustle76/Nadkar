# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

When a vendor is added with category 'executive coaching' (lowercase), it doesn't appear when filtering by 'Executive Coaching' (capitalized), and vice versa. This is because the filtering uses strict equality comparison (===) which is case-sensitive. The issue is in App.js line 452 where it filters vendors: vendors.filter(vendor => vendor.category === selectedCategory). This should be changed to use case-insensitive comparison: vendors.filter(vendor => vendor.category.toLowerCase() === selectedCategory.toLowerCase())."

    -message: "Completed testing of the updated filtering logic to remove 'Business Consulting' category and vendors. All changes have been implemented correctly: 1) No vendors with category 'Business Consulting' are displayed in the vendor list, 2) 'Business Consulting' category does not appear in the category dropdown, 3) The current vendor count is 52 after filtering (down from 53 previously), indicating that one 'Business Consulting' vendor was removed. The filtering logic in App.js line 319 now correctly includes 'Business Consulting' in the list of categories to filter out. Interestingly, 'Business Consulting' is NOT available in the form datalist for adding new vendors, while 'Executive Coaching' still is. This suggests that 'Business Consulting' was completely removed from the standardCategories array. Category filtering still works correctly for all tested categories (Dental, Tennis, Financial Services), and adding new vendors through the form works properly. All other functionality remains intact, including responsive design and form validation."

    -message: "Completed testing of the updated filtering logic to allow 'Nitin' vendors to be displayed. The changes have been successfully implemented: 1) Vendors with names starting with 'Nitin' are now visible in the vendor list - found 4 vendors with 'Nitin' in the name, including 'Nitin Nadkar' vendors, 2) The total vendor count has increased to 57 (up from 52 previously), 3) Vendors with names starting with 'Test' are still correctly filtered out, 4) Vendors with category 'Format Test' are still correctly filtered out, 5) Vendors with category 'Business Consulting' are still correctly filtered out. However, there is one issue: One vendor with category 'Executive Coaching' is still visible in the list (Nitin Nadkar), even though the filtering logic should remove vendors with this category. The category dropdown correctly excludes 'Executive Coaching' and 'Business Consulting' categories. The form datalist includes 'Executive Coaching' but not 'Business Consulting', which is consistent with previous behavior. Adding new vendors with 'Nitin' in the name works correctly, and they appear in the vendor list. Overall, the 'Nitin' name filtering has been successfully removed, but there appears to be an issue with the 'Executive Coaching' category filtering for one specific vendor."

    -message: "Completed testing of the updated filtering logic that removes specific test data entries while keeping the system flexible for future use. The current implementation successfully: 1) Filters out vendors with the specific name 'Nitin Nadkar' (exact match) while allowing other vendors with 'Nitin' in their name (found 1 vendor named 'Nitin Test Vendor' displayed), 2) Filters out vendors with categories 'Format Test', 'Executive Coaching', 'Business Consulting', and 'Legal Consulting' - none of these categories appear in the dropdown, 3) Maintains a clean category dropdown with 37 categories (including 'All Categories'), all of which have associated vendors, 4) Preserves 'Nitin Nadkar' in the footer as expected. The current vendor count is 53 after filtering. Adding new vendors works correctly, including vendors with 'Nitin' in the name (though there appears to be an issue with the alert dialog not appearing after submission). Vendors added with filtered categories (like 'Legal Consulting') are properly filtered out from the display. The system remains flexible for legitimate future entries while effectively removing test data."

    -message: "Completed testing of the updated filtering logic to remove 'Nitin Test Vendor' from the Dental category. The changes have been successfully implemented: 1) 'Nitin Test Vendor' is no longer displayed in the vendor list, including when filtering by the Dental category, 2) The total vendor count is now 52 (down from 53 previously), 3) API testing confirms that 'Nitin Test Vendor' still exists in the database (ID: 6482c365-23ab-48cc-a911-cbd1d7b48716) but is being properly filtered out by the frontend, 4) The Dental category still shows the legitimate dental vendors (Parsons Pointe Dental Care and Supriti Dental), 5) All other filtering logic continues to work correctly - vendors with names starting with 'Test' and vendors with categories 'Format Test', 'Executive Coaching', 'Business Consulting', and 'Legal Consulting' are still filtered out. The filtering logic in App.js line 317 now correctly includes 'nitin test vendor' in the list of specific names to filter out. The data now looks clean and professional with all test entries successfully removed."

    -message: "Completed testing of the performance optimizations for the BMP Yellow Pages app. All optimizations have been successfully implemented and are working effectively: 1) Image Optimization: The banner image is correctly using optimized dimensions (width=800, height=400), has the lazy loading attribute properly applied, and includes explicit height styling (320px). 2) API Caching: The app correctly implements 5-minute cache control headers for vendor API calls and falls back to static data when needed. 3) React Performance: The useMemo hooks for filtered vendors, categories, and sorted vendors are working effectively, with category filtering being very fast (averaging 0.07 seconds). 4) Render Optimization: The grid layout correctly adapts to different screen sizes (3 columns on desktop, 2 columns on tablet, 1 column on mobile). 5) Responsive Design: The layout adjusts appropriately for different screen sizes with the banner image adapting well to mobile view. Overall page load time is excellent at around 1.65 seconds for desktop, well under the 3-second requirement. Category filtering is nearly instantaneous, and the responsive design works well across all device sizes. The performance optimizations have significantly improved the user experience."

    -message: "Completed comprehensive performance analysis of the Yellow Pages app. The investigation revealed several key findings: 1) Initial page load time is approximately 1.7-2.0 seconds, with Time to First Byte (TTFB) around 40-60ms. 2) The banner image (from media.theprovidencegroup.com) is a significant bottleneck, taking 0.5-1.8 seconds to load with a size of 66KB. 3) API calls to /api/vendors are relatively fast (8-160ms) but there are multiple redundant calls (8 separate API calls observed). 4) Network connectivity between frontend and backend is good with DNS lookup taking ~35ms, TLS setup ~80ms, and total API request time ~90ms. 5) The frontend makes multiple unnecessary API calls during initialization, including repeated calls to /api/vendors/seed. 6) Console errors show 'Failed to fetch' errors for API calls, indicating potential network connectivity issues or CORS problems. 7) DOM processing time is around 320ms, which is reasonable. The main performance bottlenecks are: 1) The large banner image loading time, 2) Multiple redundant API calls, and 3) Network connectivity issues causing failed API requests. Recommended optimizations: 1) Further optimize the banner image or use a local image, 2) Reduce redundant API calls by implementing better state management, 3) Investigate and fix the network connectivity issues causing failed API requests."

    -message: "Investigated why 'Nitin Nadkar' vendors aren't consistently showing up in the vendor list. Found that there are 5 'Nitin Nadkar' vendors in the database with different categories: 1) 'executive coaching', 2) 'Wellbeing', 3) 'Executive Coaching ' (with trailing space), 4) 'Communication And Persuasion', and 5) 'Communication Skills '. The issue is in the filtering logic in App.js lines 316-327, which filters out vendors with category 'executive coaching' (lowercase). The vendor with exact category 'executive coaching' is filtered out, but the one with 'Executive Coaching ' (with trailing space) passes the filter because after lowercasing it becomes 'executive coaching ' which doesn't exactly match the filter condition. This explains why some 'Nitin Nadkar' vendors appear while others don't. The solution would be to trim whitespace before comparison: category.trim().toLowerCase() !== 'executive coaching', or to modify the filtering logic to allow all 'Nitin Nadkar' vendors regardless of category."

    -message: "Investigated the 'executive coaching' category issue. Found 5 vendors with 'executive coaching' category in the database (in various case formats): 1) Nitin Nadkar (lowercase 'executive coaching'), 2) Test Executive Coach (capitalized 'Executive Coaching'), 3) Test Business Abc (capitalized 'Executive Coaching'), 4) Category Format Test (capitalized 'Executive Coaching'), 5) Test Executive Coach (capitalized 'Executive Coaching'). The current filtering logic in App.js (lines 387-397) filters out vendors with names starting with 'test', name exactly matching 'nitin test vendor', name exactly matching 'carlos / jc painting', and category exactly matching 'format test'. However, it does NOT explicitly filter out vendors with category 'executive coaching' (in any case format). Despite this, our UI testing shows that no vendors with 'executive coaching' category are visible on the page and 'Executive Coaching' is not available in the dropdown. This suggests there might be additional filtering happening elsewhere, or the filtering logic has been updated but we're not seeing the most recent version of the code. To properly address the user's request to remove 'executive coaching' category and associated vendors, we should update the filtering logic to explicitly include: category.toLowerCase().trim() !== 'executive coaching'"
